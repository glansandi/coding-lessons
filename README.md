# Coding lessons

Hello there, for your first task you'll need to install some tools which we'll be using during this journey of ours. Hope it wont be too overwhelming, anyway just try to finish as much as possible and we'll go over these on our next call.

Apart from that, I'd suggest you start with a Javascript course on [JS Courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/), so you get somewhat familiar with the language.

In the meantime I'll prepare some computer science questions and tasks for the next lesson.

I'll try to make a list of useful resources and websites, tutorials.

## TOOLS:

These are the most essential tools we'll use. Please install all of these and
try to get somawhat familiar with them. There is a shitload of video tutorials (or you can check out some guides on [Dev.to](https://dev.to)).

### VS CODE

This is a code editor we will for writing code.
You can find it [here](https://code.visualstudio.com)

### Terminal

Terminal is your best friend. Just press `cmd + shift` and type terminal to find it. Terminal allows you to run juicy commands and also you like a hacker when using it.

### Homebrew

Homebrew is a package manager for MacOS. It allows you to install various usefull and needed software packages we'll use.
In order to install it you'll have to open your Terminal and run the command you'll find on their [homepage](https://brew.sh).

### GIT

Git is a version control system and source code management. You've probably heard about Github / Gitlab which are both providers of internet hosting servises based on git.
You can install instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/download/mac).

Also create an account on [Github](https://github.com). The whole setup might include generating some `ssh` keys and you can find guides online or will go through it together.

If you'll manage to setup git, you'll be able to add some notes to this doc by yourself and can you this repository for later.

### NPM

Node package manager (or npm) is a javascript package manager (so somewhat similiar to Homebrew. e.g. if you've heard about React, you can install it using npm). In order to install npm, you'll have ot install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#macos)

### Trello

This is not a requirement, but it's a nice addition to your workflow. I can tell you about the approach we're using when planning our tasks.

## Learning resources

List of useful resources:

I can strongly recommend both of these learning platforms.

- [freecodecamp.com](https://freecodecamp.com) - They have a nice [JS Courses](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/)
- [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) - good for training algorithms.

- [Dev.to](https://dev.to) - developer blogs and guides
